### Pictionary
The core concept of this project is to use active learning to train an image recognition machine learning model in real time through optimized interaction with the user.  
It's a bit like a typical MNIST classifier, but ideally it will require much less data and time to train.  
## How to play
1. Draw a number, letter, or shape on the screen
2. The AI will try to interpret/guess what the drawing is
3. If it is not confident in its guess, the AI will prompt for the answer (typed in with the keyboard)
4. In the background, the AI is reviewing previous drawings to improve its accuracy
5. Over time, the AI _should_ get more accurate and only prompt on classes without enough examples

## Current Status
All of that description above is what I want this to do.  
Currently, you can run the app on Android, draw squiggly lines, and clear the drawing. The AI bit will come soon.
